tilde.club
==========

This is the set of code and utilities for running and managing the
tilde.club server.

# What is tilde.club?
- http://tilde.club is one unmodified unix server on the Internet where several hundred people have accounts.
- Tilde.Club is *also* an emerging, mutually supportive community of <del>dozens</del> <del>hundreds</del> thousands of people who enjoy working with in the tool-rich, very social Unix programming environment. 
- Many, many of these people want to help new users use these open, free tools to empower themselves. Even new users who are scared of command-lines. Especially new users who want to learn but don't like being laughed at. _We won't laugh at you because we know how hard it is to learn about technology. If this is confusing we will try to help._
- [Here is the story of how tilde.club started](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf)
- [Here is the FAQ](http://tilde.club/~faq/) which is being developed here at this GitHub repository.
- No particular entity controls tilde.club. It's emerging as sort of an open, basically free mini-Internet for people who need some refuge from the regular Internet. It was founded with the rule, "no drama," a rule directly inspired by the amazing Mary J. Blige song  "No More Drama." So far there's only been a little drama. It's only been three weeks, though. Github user @ftrain is the initiator and de-facto coordinator until he burns out.

It's all moving very fast.

# Help Wanted
Tilde.club is moving very quickly.

## 1. optimal: pull requests and bug reports
- There is a lot of great work going on around config, FAQ, basic docs.
- Jump in if you want. Literally everyone here said "I am ready to help, what can I do."
- We need non-coders  (writers, editors, communicators, artists, project managers) as much as we need tech folks.
- Most of the coding work is done for us by the Unix operating system. We're celebrating that.

## 2. suboptimal: open ended feature requests and broad discussion
- We love philosophy, just not in our issue tracker!
