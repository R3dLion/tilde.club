### Tildeverse IRC Network

Although we are not looking for more servers to connect to our network currently, We welcome all tildes to use our network and enjoy conversations with the rest of the tildeverse.

## How to connect

You can connect to irc.tilde.chat on port 6697 with ssl

irc.tilde.chat is a round-robin host that will return any of the available servers

if you're getting a higher ping than you'd like, try one of the geo-round-robins: na.tilde.chat, eu.tilde.chat, and au.tilde.chat on port 6697 with ssl.

or localhost 6667 from a shell on any of the member tildes :) (port 7766 on ~town)
