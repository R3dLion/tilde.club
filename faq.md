## How did this get started?

[The origin story is here](http://tilde.club/~ford/) along with a bunch of other stuff. [Paul wrote this for Medium](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf).

## Can you help me with some things?

Maybe?  
Try checking out [~pfhawkins' Tilde Tips and Tricks page](http://tilde.club/~pfhawkins/tipsntricks.html). It's useful. He also suggests [~anthonydpaul's primer](http://tilde.club/~anthonydpaul/primer.html).

## What about the waiting list?

We've got a lot of people on the waitlist. Our goal is to get those people in to tilde.club or onto another server that they can share with other people. We have some capacity and process issues to work out first, but they're being actively worked on. We can't wait to meet you.
